# Water Quality Checking Project

## Description

This project aims to provide an AI-driven solution for analyzing and verifying water quality. By leveraging machine learning and advanced data analysis techniques, this system evaluates water parameters to ensure safety and compliance with environmental standards. The project is designed for applications in environmental monitoring, public health, and sustainable water management.

## Features

- Real-time analysis of water quality parameters (e.g., pH, turbidity, dissolved oxygen, etc.).
- Machine learning algorithms for quality prediction and anomaly detection.
- User-friendly interface for visualizing and interpreting results.
- Scalable design to support various environments (rivers, lakes, drinking water supplies, etc.).
